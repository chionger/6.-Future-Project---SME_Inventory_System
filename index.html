  <h1>SME Inventory System</h1>
  <p>Inspiration : While
    This is a page for me to tinkle with a base structure which could be
    expanded into a more sophisticated system for SMEs</p>
  <p>Motivation : The idea is to create a database that allows the user to:
  <ol>
    <li>keep track of date that inventory was added</li>
    <li>keep track of new inventory storage location and information</li>
    <li>future is to recognise stock via photo of item on display rack</li>
    <li>show quantity and size of remaining stock</li>
    <li>show location of remaining stock</li>
    <li>quantity and size will be be reduced when sales are made</li>
    <li></li>
  </ol>
